# RNA-Analyzer
analyzes a 'string' of RNA and possible reading frames and splice mechanism

Utilized knowledge learned from one of my Undergraduate Courses: 'Genetics - BIO 320'.
  -DNA is made up of two forms of nucleotide sequences: 
    introns (the DNA which gets 'cut' out and not used in transcription)
    exons (the DNA which gets glued to other exons and will be further processed to ultimately be transcribed to RNA and later translated to proteins)
  -To distinguish between introns and exons, Geneticists have discovered a unique sequence that often times help distinguish introns
    This sequence can be seen inside my code

Assumptionn I have made:
  -The sequence is static (which obviously it cannot be, there are exceptions due to flexibility of some nucleotides and mutations)

This was one of my earliest projects, created in C++. It is poorly coded and is a simple string search, subsequence, and display.
It was an educational experience creating this because it combined knowledge obtained from the real world and was utilized to have practicality.

Although this is poorly coded, this is one of my most important projects that I have created because the professors in this course
were one of my inspirations to quit my pre-med track and pursue a career in Computer Science. Logical thinking has always been my forte and 
has always interested me. Since then I have not regretted my decision.
